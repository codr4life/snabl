* move Call.state to Target._call_state
* remove Call struct
** move pos to Target._call_pos
** store raw TargetPtrs in Env._calls
* move recursive_check / _is_called to Target
* replace libs stack with single Lib *
** init to &home
* replace scopes stack with single ScopePtr
** init to main
** capture in State
** remember prev
*** swap with ptr in Fimp/LambdaRet
* replace tries stack with single ops::Try ptr
* add bench: macro
** replaces fn
* capture tries in State
** restore on recall
** remove restore_all
*** replace with individual calls
* add push/pop fns
** stack/str

** add bench/all.sl
* add support for func/fimp refs with &
** add func/fimp type
* add use: macro
* add lib: macro
** two args, id & body
** allow anonymous, _
*** push anonymous libs in current scope
*** add lib op which contains the actual lib
*** use for local defs
* add load func
** call when called with args
* add type: Foo Int macro
** derive new type from parent
** generate constructor 
* add trait: Foo (Bar Baz) macro
** derive children from type
